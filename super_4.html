            The son of scientists who use him as a test subject for various intelligence enhancement projects. 
            <br>While these treatments are ultimately successful and Victor's IQ subsequently grows to genius levels, 
            <br>they also have the side effect of causing his body to become increasingly frail and sickly.
            <br> He grows to resent his treatment.
